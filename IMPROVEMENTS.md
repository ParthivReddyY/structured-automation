## Known Issues & Future Enhancements:

### Current Limitations:
1. Voice transcription uses placeholder implementation (browser API check needed)
2. Week view is not yet implemented
3. Edit event functionality is placeholder
4. Regenerate message feature is UI-only
5. No drag-and-drop for events (future enhancement)

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. Implement actual voice transcription service (e.g., OpenAI Whisper API)
2. Add week view to calendar
3. Implement event editing functionality
4. Add drag-and-drop event rescheduling
5. Add event recurring patterns
6. Implement message regeneration logic
7. Add real-time updates with WebSocket
8. Fetch actual stats for activity sidebar
9. Add export calendar functionality (iCal)
10. Add calendar sharing features

```json
{
  "_id": "68db7adb544bf51b81911991",
  "id": "evt_1759214299924_jdtqufnwc",
  "title": "Meeting",
  "startDate": "2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "startTime": "22:00",
  "location": "Zoom workspace",
  "priority": "medium",
  "status": "scheduled",

```
