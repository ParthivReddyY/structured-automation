# Intelligent Data-to-Action System

## Project Overview

The Intelligent Data-to-Action System transforms unstructured text and documents into structured information and actionable tasks. By leveraging multiple AI models through Google Genkit's orchestration framework, the system extracts meaningful data and automates task management within a clean, intuitive interface.

## Key Examples:
**1. Meeting Reminder (Calendar + Actions)**

Input (text):
“I have a meeting at 10 PM in Zoom workspace”

Structured Output:

{
  "intent": "meeting",
  "title": "Meeting in Zoom workspace",
  "time": "22:00",
  "date": "today",
  "priority": "high"
}


Action Taken:

Saved in Actions tab with high priority.

Added to Calendar (event scheduled at 10 PM).

**2. Customer Support Request (Mails + Actions)**

Input (PDF/Docx):
“Customer John reports an issue with logging into his account. Needs urgent help.”

Structured Output:

{
  "intent": "customer_support",
  "title": "Support request - John",
  "description": "Customer cannot log into account",
  "priority": "high",
  "response_needed": true
}


Action Taken:

Added to Actions tab (support ticket).

AI generates a Mail Draft:
“Hello John, we’re sorry for the trouble. Our team is checking the login issue and will update you shortly.”

Draft available in Mails tab for review.

**3. Personal Task / To-do (To-do’s)**

Input (text):
“Buy groceries: milk, bread, and eggs tomorrow”

Structured Output:

{
  "intent": "personal_task",
  "todos": [
    { "title": "Buy milk", "priority": "medium", "due_date": "tomorrow" },
    { "title": "Buy bread", "priority": "medium", "due_date": "tomorrow" },
    { "title": "Buy eggs", "priority": "medium", "due_date": "tomorrow" }
  ]
}


Action Taken:

Added as checklist items in To-do’s tab.

Due date marked in Calendar.

**4. Notes from Meeting (Actions + Summary)**

Input (PDF of meeting notes):
“Project deadline is next Friday. Assign John to backend tasks. Review UI designs before Wednesday.”

Structured Output:

{
  "intent": "meeting_notes",
  "tasks": [
    { "title": "Project deadline", "due_date": "next Friday", "priority": "high" },
    { "title": "Backend tasks", "assignee": "John", "priority": "medium" },
    { "title": "Review UI designs", "due_date": "Wednesday", "priority": "medium" }
  ],
  "summary": "Project meeting concluded with a deadline set for next Friday..."
}


Action Taken:

Tasks saved in Actions tab.

Deadlines appear in Calendar.

Summary stored in Documents for quick reference.

**5. Work Request (Mail Draft + Actions)**

Input (image of handwritten note via OCR):
“Send monthly report to manager by Monday morning.”

Structured Output:

{
  "intent": "send_report",
  "task": "Prepare and send monthly report",
  "due_date": "Monday 9:00 AM",
  "priority": "high"
}


Action Taken:

Added to Actions tab.

Calendar entry created for Monday morning.

Mail Draft generated in Mails tab:
“Hello Manager, please find attached the monthly report. Best regards.”

**6. Simple Reminder (Actions Only)**

Input (plain text):
“Remind me to call Mom at 6 PM”

Structured Output:

{
  "intent": "reminder",
  "task": "Call Mom",
  "time": "18:00",
  "priority": "medium"
}


Action Taken:

Stored in Actions tab as a reminder.

Calendar entry created for 6 PM.

**7. Support Documentation (Documents + Notes)**

Input (Docx file):
A large support report with multiple troubleshooting steps.

Action Taken:

AI generates a summary and saves it in Documents tab.

Extracted tasks (like "Update FAQ", "Fix login bug") routed to Actions tab.

Related todos added to To-do’s.
